## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin

## Database Structure
- Employees
- Departments
- Roles
- Attendance

## Key Features
- Automatic attendance status (Present/Late)
- Trigger-based validation
- Function to calculate total working hours
- Monthly attendance report
- Late arrival analysis

## Steps Involved
1. Created normalized tables with constraints
2. Inserted sample employee and attendance data
3. Implemented trigger for attendance status
4. Created function for work-hour calculation
5. Generated reports using GROUP BY

## Conclusion
This project helps understand real-world employee data handling, automation using triggers, and SQL reporting techniques commonly used in HR systems.
